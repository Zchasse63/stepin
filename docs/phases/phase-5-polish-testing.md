## Overview

This phase focuses on adding polish, animations, comprehensive error handling, and thorough testing. The goal is to create a delightful, robust user experience that handles edge cases gracefully.

**Timeline**: Weeks 5-6  
**Dependencies**: Phases 1-4 (All core features must be implemented)

## 5.1 Animation & Delight

### Augment Code Prompt

```
Add polish animations and micro-interactions throughout Stepin:

1. Goal Celebration:
   - When user reaches daily goal:
     * Confetti burst animation (react-native-confetti-cannon)
     * Haptic feedback (Heavy impact)
     * Scale animation on step count
     * Success sound (optional, user preference)
   - Show celebration modal:
     * "Goal Complete! üéâ"
     * Friendly message
     * Share button (optional)
     * Dismiss button

2. Streak Milestone:
   - Every 7 days of streak:
     * Flame icon pulse animation
     * Congratulations badge appears
     * Gentle haptic
   - Show milestone modal:
     * "7 Day Streak! üî•"
     * Encouraging message
     * Continue button

3. Tab Bar:
   - Active tab scales slightly
   - Icon morphs with smooth transition
   - Haptic on tab change (Light impact)

4. Pull to Refresh:
   - Custom refresh animation
   - Step counter rotates while refreshing
   - Success haptic when complete

5. List Interactions:
   - Walk items slide in on mount (stagger animation)
   - Press animation on tap (scale down slightly)
   - Smooth swipe-to-delete with confirmation

6. Loading States:
   - Skeleton screens with shimmer effect
   - Never show blank screens
   - Progress indicators for long operations

7. Micro-interactions:
   - Button press: scale down 0.95
   - Toggle switches: smooth transition
   - Input focus: subtle glow
   - Modal appear/dismiss: slide up/down with fade

Implementation:
- Use react-native-reanimated for performant animations
- Use expo-haptics for tactile feedback
- Respect reduced motion accessibility setting
- All animations 60fps
- Keep animations subtle and purposeful

Create /lib/animations/celebrationAnimations.ts:
- reusable animation functions
- configurable parameters
- respects user preferences
```

## 5.2 Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Augment Code Prompt

```
Implement comprehensive error handling and edge cases:

1. Network Errors:
   - Offline state banner: "You're offline. Data will sync when connected."
   - Retry mechanism for failed Supabase calls
   - Queue writes for when connection returns
   - Show last sync time

2. Health Data Errors:
   - Permissions denied: Clear explanation + link to settings
   - HealthKit unavailable: Offer manual entry
   - Health Connect not installed: Show install instructions
   - Sync failures: Retry button + error message

3. Validation:
   - Step count: 0-200,000 (reject obvious errors)
   - Duration: 0-1440 minutes (24 hours max)
   - Date: Cannot be future date
   - Show inline error messages

4. Empty States:
   - No walks yet: Friendly illustration + call-to-action
   - No internet: Helpful message + retry button
   - No permissions: Explanation + grant button

5. Edge Cases:
   - Same walk logged twice: Warn user before creating duplicate
   - Very large step counts: Confirm before saving
   - Goal set too low: Gentle warning ("Most people aim higher")
   - Streak broken: Supportive message ("Start a new streak today!")

6. Error Boundaries:
   - App-level error boundary
   - Screen-level error boundaries
   - Graceful fallback UI
   - Error reporting (Sentry optional)

Create /components/ErrorBoundary.tsx:
- Catches render errors
- Shows friendly error screen
- "Try Again" button
- Option to report issue

Create /components/OfflineBanner.tsx:
- Appears at top when offline
- Dismissible
- Shows reconnection status

Create /lib/utils/errorMessages.ts:
- Map error codes to user-friendly messages
- Multi-language ready (for future)
```

## 5.3 Onboarding Improvements

### Augment Code Prompt

```
Enhance onboarding flow to set proper expectations and request permissions gracefully:

Create multi-step onboarding in /app/(auth)/onboarding.tsx:

Step 1 - Welcome:
- App name and logo
- Mission statement: "Celebrate every step, at your own pace"
- Key value props:
  * No competition or comparison
  * Your progress, your way
  * Simple and encouraging
- "Get Started" button

Step 2 - How It Works:
- 3 simple illustrations:
  1. "Track your steps automatically"
  2. "Set your personal goal"
  3. "Celebrate your progress"
- "Next" button

Step 3 - Goal Setting:
- "What's your daily step goal?"
- Slider (2,000 - 20,000)
- Suggestions:
  * "Starting out: 3,000-5,000 steps"
  * "Active: 7,000-10,000 steps"
  * "Very active: 10,000+ steps"
- "Remember: you can change this anytime"
- "Next" button

Step 4 - Health Permissions:
- "To track your steps automatically"
- Clear explanation why permission needed
- What data is accessed (just step count)
- What data is NOT accessed (emphasize privacy)
- "Grant Permission" button
- "Skip for now" option (allows manual entry)

Step 5 - Notifications (Optional):
- "Stay motivated with gentle reminders"
- Toggle for each notification type with description
- "All reminders are supportive, never pushy"
- "Enable Notifications" button
- "Skip" option

Step 6 - Ready:
- "You're all set! üéâ"
- Summary of setup
- "Start Walking" button

Implementation:
- Use horizontal paginated FlatList for steps
- Progress dots at bottom
- Back button (except on first step)
- Skip button on optional steps
- Save choices to Supabase profile
- Set onboarding_completed flag

Design:
- Full-screen steps
- Large, friendly illustrations
- Generous whitespace
- Easy-to-tap buttons
- System fonts and colors
```

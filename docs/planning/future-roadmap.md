## Overview

This document outlines the success criteria for the MVP, post-MVP PowerSync integration timeline, and future feature roadmap for Stepin.

---

## Success Metrics & Next Steps

### MVP Success Criteria (8 weeks post-launch)

#### Usage Metrics

**Target Goals**:
- **100+ active users** (logging walks weekly)
- **60%+ day-7 retention**
- **40%+ day-30 retention**
- **Average 4+ walks logged per user**
- **Average 3+ days per week active**

**Why these metrics**: These numbers indicate genuine product-market fit. Users are not just downloading the app, they're using it regularly and finding value in the non-competitive approach.

#### Feedback Metrics

**Target Goals**:
- **4.5+ star rating** on app stores
- **Positive qualitative feedback** about non-competitive approach
- **Users report feeling encouraged**, not pressured
- **Grandmother demographic** gives positive feedback

**Why these metrics**: Star ratings and qualitative feedback validate that the app delivers on its core promise: encouragement without competition.

#### Technical Metrics

**Target Goals**:
- **<1% crash rate**
- **<2 second app load time**
- **Health data syncs successfully >95% of time**
- **Zero critical bugs**

**Why these metrics**: Technical reliability is essential for user trust, especially with health data. Poor performance will drive users away regardless of features.

## Post-MVP: PowerSync Integration (Weeks 9-12)

Once MVP validates product-market fit, integrate PowerSync for true offline-first architecture.

### Why Wait for PowerSync?

**Validation First**: PowerSync adds complexity and cost ($35-60/month). Validate the core value proposition with Supabase first, then add offline capabilities once you know users want the product.

**Faster MVP**: Building with Supabase first gets you to market faster. You can validate the non-competitive approach without the overhead of local-first architecture.

**Better Architecture**: Once you understand real usage patterns, you can design the PowerSync integration more effectively.

### PowerSync Integration Timeline

#### Week 9: PowerSync Setup and Sync Rules

**Tasks**:
- Set up PowerSync instance
- Configure sync rules for profiles, walks, daily_stats, streaks
- Define conflict resolution strategies
- Test basic sync functionality

**Deliverables**:
- PowerSync instance configured
- Sync rules defined and tested
- Documentation for sync behavior

#### Week 10: Migrate to SQLite Local-First Architecture

**Tasks**:
- Install PowerSync SDK
- Create SQLite schema matching Supabase
- Implement local-first data layer
- Migrate Zustand stores to use local SQLite
- Update all data access to use PowerSync

**Deliverables**:
- Local SQLite database operational
- All CRUD operations working locally
- Sync to Supabase functioning

#### Week 11: Test Offline Functionality Thoroughly

**Tasks**:
- Test all features offline
- Test sync when coming back online
- Test conflict resolution
- Test with poor connectivity
- Test with large datasets
- Performance testing

**Deliverables**:
- Comprehensive offline test results
- Bug fixes for offline issues
- Performance optimizations

#### Week 12: Deploy to Production with Staged Rollout

**Tasks**:
- Deploy PowerSync-enabled version to beta
- Monitor sync performance
- Gradual rollout to all users
- Monitor for issues
- Gather user feedback

**Deliverables**:
- PowerSync in production
- Monitoring dashboards
- User feedback collected

### PowerSync Benefits

Once integrated, PowerSync provides:
- **True offline-first**: App works perfectly without internet
- **Instant interactions**: No waiting for server responses
- **Reliable sync**: Automatic conflict resolution
- **Better UX**: Smooth, fast, responsive
- **Competitive advantage**: Most walking apps require connectivity

## Feature Prioritization Principles

When deciding what to build next, always ask:

1. **Does it support the mission?** (Accessibility, encouragement, celebration)
2. **Is it non-competitive?** (No comparison, no pressure)
3. **Is it grandmother-friendly?** (Simple, clear, not overwhelming)
4. **Does it respect privacy?** (User control, opt-in, secure)
5. **Will users actually use it?** (Validate demand first)

If the answer to any of these is "no," reconsider the feature.

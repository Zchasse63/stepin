# Stepin MVP Development Plan

## Executive Summary

**Goal**: Ship a functional, non-competitive wellness walking app MVP in 6-8 weeks using Supabase, validating product-market fit before adding PowerSync offline-first capabilities.

**Core Value Proposition**: The only walking app that celebrates 2,000 steps as much as 10,000 steps, with zero competitive pressure and grandmother-friendly simplicity.

## üöÄ Quick Start

This documentation is organized into phases that guide you through building the Stepin MVP from foundation to launch. Each phase is designed to be completed sequentially, with clear acceptance criteria and implementation guidance.

### Development Timeline
- **Weeks 1-4**: Core functionality (Phases 1-4)
- **Weeks 5-6**: Polish and testing (Phase 5)
- **Weeks 7-8**: Launch preparation (Phase 6)

## üéØ Success Metrics for MVP

**Usage Goals**:
- 100 users actively logging walks weekly
- Average 4+ walks logged per user
- 60%+ day-7 retention
- Positive qualitative feedback about non-competitive approach

**Technical Goals**:
- <1% crash rate
- <2 second app load time
- Health data syncs successfully >95% of time
- 60fps animations throughout

---

## üí° Core Design Principles

1. **Grandmother-Friendly**: Large text, clear hierarchy, minimal complexity
2. **Celebration-Focused**: Positive reinforcement for ANY progress
3. **No Comparison**: Never show other users' data or competitive elements
4. **Privacy First**: User data stays under user control
5. **Accessibility**: Works for users of all abilities

---

## üí∞ Estimated Costs (First 3 Months, 1000 Users)

- **Supabase**: $0-25/month
- **Expo EAS**: $0 (hobby plan)
- **Domain**: $12/year
- **Total**: ~$25-40/month

After validation, PowerSync can be added ($35-60/month) for true offline-first experience.

## üèÅ Getting Started

1. **Read the [Implementation Guide](implementation-guide.md)** to understand how to work with Augment Code
2. **Start with [Phase 1](phase-1-foundation-auth.md)** to set up your project foundation
3. **Follow phases sequentially** - each builds on the previous
4. **Test thoroughly** after each phase before moving forward
5. **Reference the [Database Schema](database-schema.sql)** when setting up Supabase

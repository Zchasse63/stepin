## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### For First-Time Users:
1. **Start with** [`README.md`](README.md) - Get an overview and understand the project
2. **Read** [`implementation-guide.md`](implementation-guide.md) - Learn how to work with Augment Code
3. **Begin** [`phase-1-foundation-auth.md`](phase-1-foundation-auth.md) - Start building

### For Developers:
1. **Phase Documents** - Work through sequentially (Phase 1 → Phase 6)
2. **Database Schema** - Reference [`database-schema.sql`](database-schema.sql) when setting up Supabase
3. **Testing** - Use [`testing/testing-checklist.md`](testing/testing-checklist.md) after each phase

### For Project Managers:
1. **README** - Understand scope and timeline
2. **Future Roadmap** - See post-MVP plans
3. **Phase Documents** - Track progress through acceptance criteria

## 📖 Navigation Features

### Cross-References
Each phase document includes:
- **Top navigation**: Links to previous/next phases and README
- **Bottom navigation**: Links back to README and next phase
- **Inline references**: Links to related documents (database schema, testing, etc.)

### Example Navigation Flow:
```
README → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 → Phase 5 → Phase 6 → Launch
   ↓         ↓         ↓         ↓         ↓         ↓         ↓
   └─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴──→ Future Roadmap
```

## 🎯 How to Use This Structure

### Sequential Development (Recommended)
1. Read README for context
2. Review implementation guide
3. Work through Phase 1
4. Test Phase 1 (use testing checklist)
5. Move to Phase 2 only after Phase 1 acceptance criteria met
6. Repeat for all phases

### Reference-Based Development
- Use phase documents as reference while coding
- Copy Augment Code prompts directly
- Check acceptance criteria to verify completion
- Reference database schema as needed

### Testing-Driven Development
- Review testing checklist before starting each phase
- Understand what needs to be tested
- Build with testing in mind
- Verify against checklist after implementation

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### Recommended Approach:
1. Print or bookmark the testing checklist
2. Check off items as you complete them
3. Use phase acceptance criteria as milestones
4. Don't move to next phase until current phase is complete

### Phase Completion Criteria:
- ✅ All features implemented
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Relevant testing checklist items passed
- ✅ No critical bugs
- ✅ Performance targets met

---

## 🔄 Updates and Maintenance

### If You Need to Update Documentation:
- **Small changes**: Edit individual phase documents
- **Major restructuring**: Update README and phase documents
- **New features**: Add to future-roadmap.md
- **Testing additions**: Update testing/testing-checklist.md

### Original Document:

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Follow the order**: Phases build on each other
2. **Test thoroughly**: Use the testing checklist religiously
3. **Reference often**: Keep phase documents open while coding
4. **Stay focused**: Complete one phase before moving to next
5. **Ask questions**: Use implementation guide for prompting strategies
